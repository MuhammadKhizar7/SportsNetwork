  description: Khatme Nubuwwat means that Hazrat Muhammad (P.B.U.H) is the Last of
    the Prophets. The process and routine of appointing Prophets and Messengers
    by Almighty Allah has been terminated, finished, ended, stopped, and sealed.
    None will be appointed as prophet after Hazrat Muhammad (P.B.U.H). His
    prophethood will continue until the judgement day and the day after, only
    that person can claim to be a Muslim who believes in Khatme Nubuwwat and
    confesses.
