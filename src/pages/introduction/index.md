## **What is Khatme Nubuwwat?**

Khatme Nubuwwat means that Hazrat Muhammad (P.B.U.H) is the Last of the Prophets. The process and routine of appointing Prophets and Messengers by Almighty Allah has been terminated, finished, ended, stopped, and sealed. None will be appointed as prophet after Hazrat Muhammad (P.B.U.H). His prophethood will continue until the judgement day and the day after, only that person can claim to be a Muslim who believes in Khatme Nubuwwat and confesses.


 مَا كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ أَبَا أَحَدٍ مِنْ رِجَالِكُمْ وَلَٰكِنْ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَخَاتَمَ النَّبِيِّينَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمًا
> "Muhammad (P.B.U.H) is not the father of any men among you, but he is the Messenger of ALLAH and the last of the Prophets; and ALLAH is aware of all things". (Quran, Al-Ahzab 33:40)"

#### What is Qadiyanism (or so-called Ahmadiya)?

Qadiyanism is a movement started in a town called Qadiyan in India by a man called Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1839 - 1908). Initially, he declared himself as a Muslim writer; then he announced himself as a revivalist (Mujaddid); in 1891, he claimed to be the Promised Mehdi and the Promised Messiah; and in 1901, he proclaimed himself a prophet of God! In 1914 a split took place in the Qadiyani group with the accession of Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmood Ahmad, the 2nd successor; over definitions of doctrines forming the mainstream of Qadiani group. They are respectively known as Qadiani and Lahori sects. Both Qadianis group fraudulently claim to be one of the Muslim sects but infact they are unrighteous cult, kafir and non-muslim. Mirza Ghulam Qadiyani died on 26th May 1908 in Lahore (Pakistan) through illness being a victim of cholera. Mirza Ghulam was buried in a village of Qadiyan.

The Resolution of the Rabitah Al-Alam Al-Islami (Makkah) and Pakistan's constitutional amendment of 1974 declared the Qadianism (Qadianis and Lahoris) as non-Muslims.

**Purpose of this website**

Our organisation, through this web site, attempts to create awareness about the Qadiani (Ahmadiyya). We also endeavour to provide answers to the numerous requests we receive from the worldwide Muslim community for information on this group.
